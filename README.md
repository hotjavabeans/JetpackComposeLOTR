This app allows users to search a database of all characters in the Lord of the Rings books. It provides details such as the characters' race, kingdom, birth date, death date and enables the users to scroll through any quotes the character has. 

The data is supplied by The One API (to rule them all). You can check out their website here: https://the-one-api.dev/

Unfortunately the API is limited to 100 requests every 10 minutes. 

*Aragorn and Gimli are looking at the Uruk-hai, but are separated from them by a gap*

Gimli: "Oh come on, we can take ’em."<br />
Aragorn: "It’s a long way."<br />
Gimli: "Toss me."<br />
Aragorn: "What?"<br />
Gimli: "I cannot jump the distance, you’ll have to toss me."<br />
Gimli: *pauses, looks up at Aragorn*<br />
Gimli: "Don’t tell the Elf."<br />
Aragorn: "Not a word."
